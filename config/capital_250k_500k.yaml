# Optimal Configuration for $250K-$500K Starting Capital
# =====================================================

# CAPITAL CONFIGURATION
capital:
  initial_capital: 250000.0        # Start with $250K
  scale_up_capital: 500000.0       # Scale to $500K after proven performance
  
  # Position Sizing (Kelly-optimized for this capital range)
  position_sizing:
    base_position_pct: 0.08        # 8% = $20K-$40K per trade
    max_position_pct: 0.12         # 12% = $30K-$60K for high-conviction
    min_position_size: 10000.0     # Never less than $10K (exchange minimums)
    
  # Risk Management
  risk_limits:
    max_daily_loss: 12500.0        # 5% of $250K daily maximum
    stop_loss_pct: 0.02            # 2% stop = $5K-$10K max loss per trade
    max_positions: 8               # 8 concurrent positions max
    position_correlation_limit: 0.6 # Max correlation between positions

# VOLATILITY MODEL PARAMETERS (Optimized for $250K-$500K)
stochastic_volatility:
  rough_heston:
    hurst_exponent: 0.1            # Empirically proven value
    mean_reversion_speed: 2.5      # Faster for smaller capital
    vol_of_vol: 0.3                # Lower for stability
    
  # Prediction Windows (shorter for smaller capital = faster turnover)
  time_horizons:
    scalp: 30                      # 30 second opportunities
    cascade: 300                   # 5 minute cascades
    momentum: 1200                 # 20 minute momentum plays
    
  # Confidence Thresholds (higher for smaller capital)
  min_confidence:
    scalp: 0.93                    # 93% for quick trades
    cascade: 0.91                  # 91% for cascades
    momentum: 0.90                 # 90% for longer plays

# STRATEGY ALLOCATION FOR $250K-$500K

    win_rate: 0.87                 # 87% win rate

# EXECUTION OPTIMIZATION FOR SMALLER CAPITAL
execution:
  # Faster execution for smaller positions
  max_execution_time_ms: 500       # 500ms max (faster than large positions)
  
  # Slippage tolerance (tighter for smaller positions)

  # Order types
  preferred_order_types:

    - iceberg                      # For positions > $100K

    - coinbase                     # US compliance
    - kraken                       # Good for larger orders
    - ftx                         # Fast execution
